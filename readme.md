running code for a Single Page Application using web Development skills.

## Purpose

This is a HTML5 / JS / CSS (Single Page Application) developed with Sublime Text and Chrome.

It was created to showcase my skills after completing the teaching portion of the Web Development training; using all the skills I've developed over the two weeks to create a simple but solid game from the ground up.

## Functionality

This is a simple application that displays a single page with instructions, start and reset buttons. Along with the gameboard, a timer and a scoring system. 

## Implementation

The functionality has been implemented using the following features:

* Sublime Text
* Twitter Bootstrap 4
* Javascript through Jquery
* semantic HTML5
* HTML5 audio
* well-structured CSS
* minimalist design


### Building

I began the process with sketches of the site, I knew I wanted a whack-a-mole type game, so I added a grid; I knew I wanted a start and reset button, with a scoring system and timer; so I added them too; with a large title at the top. It started looking like a structured site. I then broke it up into what it's skeleton would be, a 9-3 bootstrap row is what I landed on in the end.

I started with the framework, bootstrap. I created the row with two columns and populated one with my 4x4 grid in css (a ul with 16 lis). After that I began to focus on mechanics; I needed a randomly generated number to corrispond to a location on my grid. I did this by    

### Running

Set up local web servers to point to `dist/dev` and `dist/prod` for _dev_ and _prod_ distributions, respectively.
